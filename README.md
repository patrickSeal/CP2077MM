# Cyberpunk 2077 Mod Manager
An open-source mod manager for Cyberpunk 2077. Install and delete your mods with a beautiful user interface. The manager informs you about the requirements that you need and keeps track of all the files installed by mods, to safely remove them at any time.

### Important:
This is a pre-release and therefore lacks many features that I want to add in the future.
But the basic functionality is there, for installing, deleting and informing about the mods you want to use.

## 1. Installation:
* Download the zip file from NexusMods
* Extract the zip file
* Run the "CP2077MM.exe" file


## 2. Currently supported features:
﻿- Installing mods from zip files (into the standard directory)
﻿- Deleting mods safely (using the Uninstall by ID option -> easier option will be added in the next update)
﻿- Informing about requirements when installing a mod
﻿- Informing about requirements of installed mods, if not installed
﻿- Uses NexusModsAPI for metadata information about the mods
﻿- Verifys a mod with NexusMods hash

## 3. Features in Development:
﻿- adding non standard installation options for mods (maybe through json file provided by the mod author or the mod manager)
﻿- adding update mod functionality

## 4. Features that potentially will be added in the future:
﻿- managing config files of mods
﻿- downloading and updating mods using the manager (only for NexusMods Premium users)
﻿- many more things...

## 5. Deinstallation:
﻿- Delete the directory where you installed the mod
﻿- Delete the "CP2077ModManager" directory in "C:\ProgramData\"
